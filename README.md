# Interactive Dex

This is a sample project made for my portfolio, it showcases the first 151 pokemon in an interactive Pokedex made with VueJs and tailwind. It allows the user to search by name, displays a 3D gif of the pokemon, the pokedex entry, the number, the stats and the cry of the pokemon if clicked on the image. It can also navigate using the arrows on the pokedex
